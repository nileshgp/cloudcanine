## Why I build this project

This project was based on an initial project that I had created whilst learning about web development. [AirCamp]('https://whispering-garden-41522.herokuapp.com/') <br>
I wanted to take this project and create something of my own and add more feautures to it. As a dog lover I wanted to create a place <br>
Where dog enthusiasts could get all the needs kind of like a doghub. After doing some research I couldn't kind anything like it so I decided to <br>
create this web app. It's nothing to serious just for some fun. 

## What I learned

I learned many things during this project to name a few:

<ul>
<li>Google maps API</li>
<li>NodeJs</li>
<li>Express</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
<li>JS</li>
<li>Passport</li>
<li>Node Mailer</li>
<li>Auth</li>
<li>Tokens</li>
<li>Routing</li>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Aync</li>
<li>Many Other things</li>
</ul>

## Features (things that should work ðŸ™„)

<ul>
<li>Login, password reset. (to imrpove form validation and error when wrong password is inputed)</li>
<li>Image upload (using cloudinary) (need to check whether its oen image or several for the image carousel</li>
<li>Google Maps api (auto fill based on search and populate data back from db)</li>
<li>Filters and fuzzy search</li>
<li>Notifications</li>
<li>Subscription</li>
<li>User Model</li>
<li>and more...</li>
</ul>

## The steps to test this feature out include: 

Create two users.
Log in with the first user and create a listing.
Log in with the second user and go to that listing.
Click the author's name to go to his/her profile
Click Follow button
Logout and log back in with original user
Create another listing
Log back in with second user and see the notification
